changes:
  - bugfix: "Shift right click now counts as a right click rather than a shift click. Rejoice, right click for context menu enjoyers!"
  - qol: "Cyborgs can now do right click inhand actions on their module items (like decreasing the transfer amount on beakers)"
  - qol: "Telekinesis users can now right click their TK grab inhand to do a right click inhand action on the grabbed item"
  - rscadd: "Intents now fully emulate ctrl clicking on grab intent and right clicking on disarm intent"
  - rscadd: "When using intents, you can now use right click to shove people while not specifically on disarm intent"
  - rscadd: "Grab intent and disarm intent are now considered combat intents (equivalent to having combat mode turned on), blocking people from passing through you"
  - bugfix: "Indirectly fixed certain martial arts (combos and attacks) not registering while on grab intent or disarm intent. If you use intents and don't want to use your martial art when shoving or grabbing, stay on help intent!"
  - bugfix: "Fixed grabs not registering your martial arts when using ctrl clicks, including combos"
  - bugfix: "Fixed AI secretly having combat mode"
  - rscdel: "You can no longer scope in when telekinetically using a gun with a scope"
  - code_imp: "A lot of things now listen to what your interaction mode says rather than checking your raw mouse input. This should not be super noticable, but things might break anyways..."
